# Command Line

## Introduction

There are two ways to interact with a computer via its operating system: GUI (graphic user interface) and CLI (command line interface). CLI is often called shell because it works as a shell of an operating system to let advanced users, administrators and programmers to use the computer.

There are serveral CLI/shells for each computer operating system. Windows comes with the command prompt (`cmd`) and power shell. MacOS and Linux/Unix have `bash`, `csh` and `zsh` etc. The default shell for new MacOS is `zsh`. Old MacOS uses `bash`.

Windows 10 comes with two CLI applications: `cmd` command line and `powershell`. `cmd` is a very old and simple CLI that is enough for many development tasks. `powershell` is new and more powerful but not compatible with `cmd`. It is only used by advanced Windows developers. Some Windows Applications may install a shell. For example, the Git client for Windows isntalls a `bash`. Additionally Windows 10 can install a Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL) to use Linux shells.

## Things a Programmer Should Know

A programmer is a power user of a computer. Often the CLI is the most effecient, sometiems the only way in case a server doesn't have a GUI subsystem, to run different tools/applications. The good news is that you only need to know some basic commands accomplish most programming tasks. The commands include the following:

- navigate and list directories/files. A directory is also called a folder and folders are organized in a tree structure that the top folder is called the root folder `/` in MacOS/linux and `\` in Windows.
- create, move and delete directories/files.
- set/delete enviornment variables. The most useful environment variable is `path`. An operating system uses `path` to find the location to execute a command.

## Learn CLI

### Windows Command Prompt

To learn the Windows command line `cmd`, watch the YouTube videos [Windows Command Line Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBBWVgE0ewk&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGDV6SnbINlVUd0o2xT4JbMu). The first four videos are enough and totally take about 20 minutes.

### MacOS/Linux CLI

The [Absolute BEGINNER Guide to the Mac OS Terminal](https://youtu.be/aKRYQsKR46I) is a good start for beginners.

## The Missing Semester of Your CS Education

To become an advanced user of your computer, you need to learn a little bit more. The [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is an introduction course in MIT. It has the text and vidoes of learning the basic tools for programming.

The first 6 lessons are useful, for now and for a long time in your professional career. You won't regret if you learn it.
