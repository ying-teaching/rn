# Install Development Tools

You need the following development tools to develop RN apps.

- [Command Line Interface](commandline.md): introduction of command line tool. Please read and learn this first if you don't know CLI. It is must-to-know for a programmer.
- [Install and setup VS Code](./vscode.md): how to install and setup Visual Studo Code (VS Code).
- [Install Node and Expo](node-and-expo.md): how to install Node.js and Expo.
- [Git and GitHub](git-and-github.md): use GitHub to manage your software source code.

We don't cover publishing app to stores because it requires fees (one-time $25 for Android, annual $99 for Apple App Store) and is time consuming in both registration/setup/review. If you like to know the process, please check the following two videos -- both were posted in January 2022 and may change as Expo or Apple/Google change their process:
