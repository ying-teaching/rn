# VS Code

## Install

Go to [VS Code docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) to learn and install VS Code for your operating system. It should be easy but in case you are not sure, you can check the following resources.

- For Windows, follow the [VS Code on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code 2020](https://youtu.be/7yLXtkSsRKE).
- For Mac OS, follow the [VS Code on macOS instruction](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) or watch the video [How to Install VS Code on Mac](https://youtu.be/IATbkNl8qng).

Programmers often run VS Code from the command line. There is an extra step to enable this in Mac OS. Please follow the instruction in [launching form the command line](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

VSCode extensions are dev tools that make you more productive. To install an extension, click the extension icon on the left, type the extension name in the search box, then click the install button.

## Learn VS Code

VS code has a rich set of editing features and it is extensible. Click `Help -> Welcome`, you can see the Welcome screen. It has shortcuts to create a new file, open a folder, recent projects and a lot help information.

You should find time to go through the first 5 videos in [Introductory Videos](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/introvideos) to learn the basic functions such as user interface, extensions, shortcut keys, code editing, file operations, and settings. Though examples are JavaScript or text files, most operations are the same for other program languages. The more you know about the VS code, the more efficient you will be. You should invest time to learn it. In addition to the five vidoes, You should also read the following sections

- [Tips and Tricks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks)
- [User Interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)
- [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings)

For detail information about a specific feature, check the [VS Code User Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics). You should be familiar with the functions described in the first four sections: Basic Editing, Extension Marketplace, IntelliSense, and Code Navigation.
