# Style and Layout

## 1 View, Components and Elements

From [React Native Document](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react-native-components):

> In Android and iOS development, a view is the basic building block of UI: a small rectangular element on the screen which can be used to display text, images, or respond to user input. Even the smallest visual elements of an app, like a line of text or a button, are kinds of views. Some kinds of views can contain other views. Itâ€™s views all the way down!

React Native uses components that are backed by the corresponding Android and iOS views. These platform-backed components are called `Native Components`. RN provides a set of commonly used Native comonents. These are RN's [Core Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis). Components are composable -- it means that a component can have one or more sub components. It is an individual resualble piece of a React App.

A component rendered in a screen is called a React **Element**. Elements in a screen are organized as a tree. Formally, the component is the `type` of rendered element. A component may have many properties (called `props`) such as `style` or component-specific setup data. For example, a `<Button>` component has a `title` prop to specifies the button text. You use component property names to initialize its props. For exxmple, `<Button title="Submit" />`.

In summary, when you create a UI element, you use JSX to specify a component as its type and provide one or more props (including `style`) to initialize its view.

## 2 Style

All RN core components accept a `style` property. The value is an object whose property names are CSS style names and values are CSS values. Because JavaScript doesn't allow `-` in a property name, you should use camel casing names. For example, use `backgroundColor` instead of `background-color`, use `fontSize` instead of `font-size`.

All dimensions such as `width` and `height` in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

The common practice is to use `StyleSheet.create` define several styles for subcomponents in one place. You can define inline styles using JS object. The following example uses both styles:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text
        style={{
          fontSize: 20,
          color: 'teal',
        }}
      >
        Hello, world!
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
});
```

## 3 Layout

### 3.1 Layout with Flexbox

RN layout is based on Flexbox. The [Layout with Flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox) is a must-read. Follwoing are commonly used styles:

- Container Styles
  - `flexDirection`: this defines the `main axis`, can be either `column` or `row`. In RN, default is `column`. Items are placed from top to bottome.
  - `justify-content`: this defines the alignment of items along the main axis. Common values are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around` and `space-evenly`.
  - `align-items`: this defines the alignment of items along the cross axis. Common values are `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, and `baseline`.
  - `align-content`: this aligns the container's lines when there is extra space in cross-axis. Values are `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.
- Item Styles
  - `flex`: a single value defines the relative size of the item.
  - `align-self`: this overrides container's `align-items`value for this item.

### 3.2 The Yaga Engine

The RN layout engine is called [Yaga](https://yogalayout.com/). It is based on the CSS flexbox layout with a few exceptions.

- `flexDirection` defaulting to `column` instead of `row`.
- `alignContent` defaulting to flex-start instead of stretch
- the `flex` parameter only supporting a single number.

Many RN components are both containers and items thus they use all the above styles. The [Yaga Documentation](https://yogalayout.com/docs) describes each properties and gives some examples. You can try with its [Palyground](https://yogalayout.com/playground).

### 4.2 W3C Flexbox Resources

CSS uses box model for UI style. Flexbox stands for flexible box that is a W3C recommended method to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container.

You can learn the basics from [a complete guide to flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Pay attention to concepts such as `main axis`, `cross axis`, `flex direction`, `align items` and `justify content`. There are properties for the container and properties for the items.

You can ues [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) to play and learn the layout.
