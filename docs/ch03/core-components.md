# Core Components

RN provides a set of commonly used [Core Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis). The core components can be classified into the following categories:

- Basic Components: `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Image>`, `<TextInput>`, `<ScrollView>` and `<StyleSheet>`.
- User Interface: `<Button>` and `<Switch>`.
- List Views: `<FlatList>`, `<SectoinList>`.
- Android-specific Components.
- iOS Components.
- Others: such as `<Alert>`, `<Modal>`, `StatusBar` etc.

For the complete list of core components and their API, please check [Core Components doc](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis).

Here we only conver some commonly used core components.

[`<View>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/view): A container that supports layout with flexbox, style, some touch handling, and accessibility controls. View maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a UIView (iOS), `<div>` (Web), android.view (Android), etc.

[`<Text>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/text): a component for display text. It supports nesting, sytling and touch handling.

[`<Image>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/image): A React component for displaying different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.

[`<Button>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button): A simple clickable button. If you want a cusotmized button, check [Custom Button](https://docs.expo.io/tutorial/button/) to create a custom button using `<TouchableOpacity>`.

[`<Switch>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/switch).

[`<TextInput>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-text-input).

[`<ScrollView>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-scrollview).

[`<FlatList>` and `<SectoinList>`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/using-a-listview).
