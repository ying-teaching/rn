# JavaScript, CSS and JSX

In this section, we introduct the relationship among Web page, React and React Native. Then we give a quick introduction to each underlying technogogy: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and JSX.

## 1 The Big Picture: Web Page, React and React Native

In WWW, when you type an URL or click a web link, the HTTPS protocol will return a web page. A web page is an user interface to a Web site, also called a Web application.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for **building user interfaces**. It is a component-based framework that simplifies Web development. A component is a reusable, composable UI construct that consists of low level HTML elements, CSS styles and JavaScript functions.

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) combines the best parts of mobile app native development with React for building cross-platform user interfaces. It extends the React web-based UI to run in Web, smart phones (iOS and Android) and desktops. In the future, the list may include game consoles, TVs and more.

### 1.1 Web Page

A web page has three parts: data, style and behaior.

- The data is constructed using HTML. Check [HTML Bascis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics).
- The style is define using CSS. Check [CSS Bascis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics)
- The behavior is created using JavaScript. Check [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics).

React and React Native use JavaScript or TypeScript (JS with Type) as its programming language. It uses the CSS to style UI components. JSX is a special syntax to mix JavaScript, UI components and styles together.

## 2 Web Learning Resources

### 2.1 HTML & CSS

- [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). In React Native, the HTML elements will be replaced by React Native elements and the CSS styles have different names.

- [Learn CSS](https://web.dev/learn/css/)

### 2.2 Javascript

A quick review of new JavaScript features, check the [Modern JavaScript](https://turriate.com/articles/modern-javascript-everything-you-missed-over-10-years). The commonly used features include:

- [Arrow functions](https://turriate.com/articles/modern-javascript-everything-you-missed-over-10-years#arrows)
- [Nullish coalescing](https://turriate.com/articles/modern-javascript-everything-you-missed-over-10-years#optional-chaining)
- [Spread Operator](https://turriate.com/articles/modern-javascript-everything-you-missed-over-10-years#spread)
