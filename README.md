# React Native Lecture Notes

## Features

- The cutting edge technology: react hooks.
- Functional programming: simple code.
- The 80/20 rules: learn the 20% that can accomplish 80% of the job.
- Pratical: a lot of code examples and exercises.

## Prerequisite

You should have some programming experience and know the basic HTML/CSS concepts. An introduction course in JavaScript or Python programming is good enough. If JavaScript and CSS are new for you, [ch02 JS, CSS and JSX](docs/ch02) has the resources for JS and CSS. We will explain the advanced concepts when we use them.
