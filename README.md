# React Native Lecture Notes

## Prerequisite

You should have some programming experience. An introduction course in JavaScript or Python programming is good enough. If JavaScript is new for you, the Part I of the book [The JavaScript Way](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway) should be sufficient. Some of the commonly used advanced JavaScript features are covered in [Modern Javascript: : Everything you missed over the last 10 years](https://turriate.com/articles/modern-javascript-everything-you-missed-over-10-years). We will explain the advanced concepts when we use them.

## Features

- The cutting edge technology: react hooks.
- Functional programming: simple code.
- The 80/20 rules: learn the 20% that can accomplish 80% of the job.
- Pratical: a lot of code examples and exercises.
